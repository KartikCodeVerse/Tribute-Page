        Time", was a worldwide hit and was certified Platinum in Canada and the

        which was also an international success. He became the first artist to
        have seven songs from a debut record chart on the Billboard Hot 100. In
        2010, he released his first full-length studio album, My World 2.0. He
        also released a successful concert film, Justin Bieber: Never Say Never
        (2011). In 2012, he released his third studio album, Believe. In 2015,
        he released his fourth studio album, Purpose. He has won a Grammy Award
        and an American Music Award. He has been listed numerous times by Forbes
        magazine among the "Top Ten Most Powerful Celebrities in the World." He
